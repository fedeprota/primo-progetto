# Copilot Instructions

## Skill-first workflow
- When a user prompt asks for "skill", "framework", "copywriting", "landing", "conversion", or references project methods, check the `skill/` folder first.
- Priority order for this project:
  1. `skill/sales-landing-page/SKILL.md`
  2. `skill/sales-landing-page/SECTION-FRAMEWORK.md`
  3. `skill/sales-landing-page/COPYWRITING-PRINCIPLES.md`
  4. `skill/sales-landing-page/CHECKLIST.md`

## Implementation policy
- Apply the skill framework before UI polish.
- Keep section order aligned with the sales framework when building landing pages.
- Validate mobile readability and CTA clarity before finishing.
